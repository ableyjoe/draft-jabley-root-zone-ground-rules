        Base Protocol Requirements for the Root Zone of the DNS
               draft-jabley-root-zone-ground-rules-latest

Abstract

   The root zone of the DNS is, in almost all ways, a DNS zone like any
   other.  However, there are a small number of ways in which the root
   zone has special requirements, for reasons relating to DNS protocol
   or operational considerations.  This document describes some ways in
   which the root zone is special and imposes corresponding technical
   requirements on the contents of the root zone.  These requirements
   form a minimal starting point for other policies that relate to the
   root zone of the DNS, many of which are developed and implemented
   outside the IETF.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS), originally specified in [RFC1034] and
   [RFC1035], implements a namespace that is distributed structurally as
   a collection of zones, connected together as a tree.  The root zone
   in the DNS is the ancestor of all other zones.

   From the perspective of the DNS protocol, all zones in the DNS share
   the same essential properties.  However, the root zone is special in
   some ways by virtue of its location within the namespace.  For
   example, as the ancestor of all other zones, a chain of trust to a
   key used to generate signatures in other zones relies upon secure
   delegations being used from the root zone for direct children.

   This document describes a minimal set of technical constraints for
   the construction of the root zone.  This document specifically does
   not aim to encapsulate a complete or sufficient set of policies for
   the root zone to meet the wider requirements of the DNS, for all of
   which this document defers to other competent authorities.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes a familiarity with the DNS terminology
   described in [RFC9499].

3.  Technical, Protocol Constraints on Root Zone Generation

3.1.  Constraints on Root Zone Apex Resource Record Sets

   The root zone MUST include exactly one SOA resource record with empty
   owner name and class IN.  This is a consequence of the requirements
   for DNS zones described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].

   The root zone MUST include an NS resource record set with empty owner
   name and class IN, as described in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].  This is
   a consequence of the requirements for DNS zones described in
   [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].

   This document does not specify particular values for the SOA
   parameters included in the SOA resource record RDATA, the NS record
   targets, the number of NS resource records in the NS RRSet or the TTL
   of any of the RRSets described above.  All such policy decisions are
   instead deferred to the appropriate competent authorities.

   The root zone MUST NOT include A or AAAA resource records with empty
   owner name and class IN.  Multiple specifications make use of an
   empty domain name to mean "not available", including [RFC2782],
   [RFC7505] and [RFC9460].  However, some naive DNS clients are
   observed to misinterpret such signals, with the result that queries
   with empty QNAME, QCLASS="IN" and QTYPE="A" or "AAAA" are observed at
   root servers.  Positive responses to such queries would have poor
   security characteristics and are therefore prohibited.

3.2.  DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)

   DNSSEC MUST be deployed in the root zone, as specified in [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034] and [RFC4035].

   This document does not specify practices around key management,
   signature generation, algorithm choice or any other parameter
   choices.

   It is acknowledged that correct and proper management of DNSSEC in
   the root zone includes making pragmatic, operational decisions, and
   this document specifically does not specify how DNSSEC should be
   deployed in any particular circumstance or at any particular time.
   All such policy decisions are instead deferred to the appropriate
   competent authorities.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document aims to provide certainty for fundamental, technical
   protocol aspects of the root zone of the DNS, including the
   deployment of DNSSEC in the root zone.

   This document does not present any new risks to the Internet.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes technical, protocol constraints on the
   generation of the DNS root zone which should be incorporated as
   appropriate into the root zone management responsibilities of the
   IANA.
